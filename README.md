This folder contains the source file of an Android app running on Zenbo, a social robot made by ASUS Inc.
The Android Studio I use to build this project is 3.4.1.
The Zenbo's OS build number is MMB29M.TW_Zenbo-13.10.5.122-20190615.

**Requirement**

This program needs to run on a Zenbo robot. Although this problem can be installed in Android devices, it won't work.
